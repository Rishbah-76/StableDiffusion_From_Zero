# Stable Diffusion From Zero

This repository contains a zero-to-hero implementation of the Stable Diffusion model. It includes various components such as:

- **Self-attention mechanisms**: Used for processing sequential and spatial data
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)**: For efficient representation learning
- **CLIP Encoder**: A transformer-based encoder for understanding visual content
